# A Bit About Me

I am a full stack software engineer located in Boston, MA.  I currently work on the Search team at Pluralsight, where we focus on helping users discover content relevant to their queries.  I graduated from Providence College with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics.  I enjoy full stack web development projects, problem solving, and I am fascinated by user experience principles.


In my free time, you can catch me blaring some Beyonc√© and Taylor Swift while going for a walk or run.  I love hanging with friends and trying new restaraunts whenever I get a chance.  I'm obsessed with dogs and you can always count on me to send you too many pictures of my yellow lab, Buddy!  [See?](../images/buddy.jpg)
